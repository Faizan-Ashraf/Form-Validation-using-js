# Form-Validation-using-js

This project is a simple form validation web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It ensures that users enter valid information into a form before submission. The validation checks include name, age, gender, file type, email, and password requirements.

## Features

- **Client-Side Validation**: Validates user input on the client side before sending data to the server.
- **Custom Error Messages**: Displays custom error messages next to each input field when validation fails.
- **Responsive Design**: Uses CSS to ensure the form is well-presented on different devices and screen sizes.
- **Gender Restriction**: Currently, the form only allows male users to submit.
